    I’ve heard and seen a lot of “What language should I pick first?” Questions in my time as a developer. It’s an interesting question that I seem to have the opposite response to most.

Lately I’ve been writing blog posts every single day. You might of noticed the content output has increased, this is because I challenged to write a single post a day. I got an interesting question on Twitter which was

> Do you “recycle” your blog post as YT videos?

The answer was yes some of my posts get repurposed into content for YouTube. So content recycling should you? Yes!

## Why content recycling is good

Content recycling is good for a number of reasons but here are the reasons I do it:

-   My audience on YouTube is not the same as my blog
-   Some people prefer written content over video content
-   Pictures say a 1000 words and something’s words say a thousand pictures.

On top of this, I want to be able to provide educational content everywhere, I know my subscribers on YouTube are looking for very specific contents around web development. Similarly my blog posts can be on a variety of topics and some people will read them and others won’t.

Cross-posting leads to cross pollinating followers, which allows you to create more content for like minded people.

## Why only some of my content gets recycled

I write a lot of content, and when I am writing it, I know whether or not I want to turn it into a video. There are things I look for:

-   Is this something that I can explain using a video in 15mins or if it’s a crash course < 1hr.
-   Is this on topic and brand for my YouTube channel
-   Could a video enhance or bring the same level of quality as my blog post.

If one of those is not true it won’t be added to the list of things. I want to post on my YouTube channel.

Tell me what you think, should you recycle content that you write or should everything be seperate?
