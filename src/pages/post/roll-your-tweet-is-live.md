    I’ve heard and seen a lot of “What language should I pick first?” Questions in my time as a developer. It’s an interesting question that I seem to have the opposite response to most.

Today is the day! Roll Your Tweet is live!

## What is Roll Your Tweet?

Roll your tweet is a SaaS that allows you to turn a twitter thread into a blog post. You can even share on your favorite platforms such as Hashnode or Medium. I built this solo in about 30 days (blog post to come soon)

## How does it work?

1. Select Twitter thread or tweet from your page:

![Choose your tweet.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1633651652741/A7QN9Fowp.png)

2. Add any content that you want using our Markdown editor:

3. Select the platforms you want to share to and increase your impact.

### What is coming in the future?

I am working on Wordpress integrations and the ability to turn your awesome blog posts into high impact Twitter threads allowing you to get your content in front of more people.
