    I have learnt alot since starting my own microsaas so here is the first 30days.

It has been just over 30 days since I launched [@roll_your_tweet](https://twitter.com/roll_your_tweet) so here is things I have learnt so far from zero to SaaS in 32 days and beyond.

### Code is 10%

The product / application is sub 10% of the work in the beginning. I wrote shit code, in fact a lot of it is still there. The other 90% is networking, marketing and explaining what you do to solve a problem.

### Marketing is hard

Marketing is hard, so if you are indie hacking read some books on marketing. For example:

-   Zero to Sold
-   Embedded Entrepreneur
-   The Mom Test

These books will give you actionable items to follow that will allow you to get the right people in front of your SaaS

### Stick yourself out there

Don't be afraid of sticking yourself out there, at first I was a bit shy of prompting people that I had built this SaaS and I think it's worth the time to check it out.

Talk about your product when you get a chance, especially in circles of like minded people.

### The first sale is not the hardest.

They say the first sale is the hardest, I disagree... 2-100 are harder because you need people to talk about your product and one customer might not be enough.

Be an advocate, and be strategic about it.

### Change, fail, repeat.

Don't be afraid to change, fail and try again. Roll Your Tweet has been micro tweaked based on feedback from users. So talk to users, tweak, ask again!
